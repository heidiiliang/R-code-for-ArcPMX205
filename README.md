This repository contains the R scripts used to produce the figures in the Main Text and Supplemental Materials of the paper "C5aR1 antagonism suppresses inflammatory glial responses and alters cellular signaling in Alzheimerâ€™s disease mouse model" in Schartz, et al. Nature Communications, 2024. 

R and R studio are required for this code. This code has been tested with R 4.2.1. Required R packages can be found at the beginning of the R scripts. The R script contains complete instructions to run on data. Expected outputs are the figures in the paper.

Please follow the installation instructions on https://www.r-project.org/ to install R and required packages. Typical installation and run time range from 2 to 4 hours on a "normal" computer with sufficient memory.
