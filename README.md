This repository contains the R scripts used to produce the figures in the Main Text and Supplemental Materials of the paper "C5aR1 antagonism suppresses inflammatory glial gene expression and alters cellular signaling in an aggressive Alzheimerâ€™s model" on Nature Communications. 

R and R studio are required for this code. This code has been tested with R 4.2.1. Required R packages can be found at the beginning of the R scripts. The R script contains complete instructions to run on data. Expected outputs are the figures in the paper.

Please follow the installation instructions on https://www.r-project.org/ to install R and required packages. Typical installation and run time range from 2 to 4 hours on a "normal" computer with sufficient memory.
